# NetworkTree - Coding Challenge

This project is a React Native application built with Expo that features a horizontally scrollable carousel of U.S. states. Users can interact with the carousel to select a state, and the app highlights the selected state dynamically. The data is fetched from a backend server built with Node.js and Express.js, which serves a list of U.S. states through a RESTful API endpoint. To run the project, clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:ChangIsHere/NetworkTree.git` and navigate to the project directory. Install the dependencies with `npm install`. Start the backend server by running `node backend/server.js` to serve the states data. Then, launch the mobile application using `npx expo start` and scan the QR code with the Expo Go app to test the app on a physical device. The project showcases a simple implementation of stateful user interactions and dynamic rendering with React Native, coupled with a lightweight Express.js server for API integration. It employs technologies such as React Native for the frontend, Expo for app bundling and testing, Node.js for backend logic, and Express.js for routing. The app provides a visually appealing and functional way to interact with data, leveraging the power of mobile development frameworks and backend technologies.
